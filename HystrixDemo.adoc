Spring Cloud Hystrix Demo
------------------------

This demo will show the Hystrix circuit breaker and bulk head patterns in action.

Approximate time: 10-15 minutes

Context
~~~~~~~
The book-svc service is calling out to the book-details-svc service to get book data.  The book
service also has simple in-memory cache of book data that it will use for a fallback if it can't
successfully retrieve it from the book details service. Separate Hystrix circuit breakers wrap both
the external call out to the details service and the internal call to the cache.  The two circuit
breakers are setup to use separate thread pools.

The book-svc is using a Feign client to call out the the book-detail-svc.  It will automatically name
the circuit breakers it creates and those are the names that will appear in the Dashboard (NOTE: These are not great names for
demo purposes but I couldn't find a way to rename them.  I will look around some more to see if it is possible). The circuit
breaker names used in this demos will be the following:

* *BookDetailSvcFeignClient#getBookDetailsByIsbn(String)* - Circuit Breaker for the Primary method (calling the details service)
* *getBookDetailsByIsbn* - Circuit Breaker for the Fallback method (using the cache data)

Setup
~~~~~
* Run a discovery server
* Run a hystrix dashboard
* Run the book-detail-svc
** Located at https://github.com/wbauern/book-detail-sv
** Runs on port 8090
* Run the book-svc :
** Located at https://github.com/wbauern/book-svc
** Runs on port 8080
* Run JMeter
** JMeter scripts used for demo located in:

Circuit Breaker Demo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This part of the demo will use a load test with JMeter to put load on a   The book-details-svc can then be killed and restarted to show via the dashboard how the circuit breaker handles it with no errors.

Demo Steps:
^^^^^^^^^^^

. Load the book-svc-steady-load.jmx script in JMeter
. Go to the Hystrix Dashboard: http://localhost:8686/hytrix
. Enter the URL to the book-svc hystrix stream: http://localhost:8080/hystrix.stream , enter a title of Book Service and then
click the Monitor Stream button.
. Explain how you don't see any circuit breakers in the dashboard until they actually start receiving requests.
. In JMeter click on the Summary Report component for the load test and start the test
. Point out the Error % column and how it will reflect any responses that a client receives.
. Show the Hystrix dashboard and click on the Alphabetically link at the top of the screen.  This will keep the circuit breakers
ordered by name instead of load and prevent them from swapping positions during the demo.
. Kill the book-detail-svc and talk to what is happening in the dashboard.
.. Failures start to occur and are routed to the fallback method.
.. The fallback circuit breaker appears on the Dashboard as it begins to receive requests.
.. The breaker on the primary opens and all load is being handled by the fallback.
.. Point out that the primary will still be hit occasionally to see if it is back up (half-open state).
. Show the Error % in JMeter and point out that no errors were received by the client.
. Start up the book-detail-svc and show the Dashboard again.
.. There may be a 30 - 60 second period before the load starts getting handled by the svc again.  Explain why: the service needs to
register and won't be visible to the book-svc until its service registry information has been refreshed.
.. Point out on the Dashboard the load shifting back to the primary circuit breaker.
. Again emphasize that the primary dependency of the book service went down and back up with not a single error returned to the client.


Bulkhead Demo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This part of the demo will use a JMeter load test with high concurrent thread count to put heavy load on the book service. The circuit breaker around the external call to the details service has created a bulkhead around it with a limit of 10 concurrent active threads.  When this is exceeded any extra load will be shed to the fallback method so that it doesn't overwhelm the details service.

Demo Steps:
^^^^^^^^^^^

. Load the book-svc-heavy-load.jmx script in JMeter
. The Hystrix Dashboard should still be running from the previous demo.
.. Point out the thread pool sizes of the primary and fallback circuit breakers.  They both have separate thread pools with 10 max threads.
. In JMeter show in the Load Generator component that it will be using 13 concurrent threads during the test.  Then click on the Summary
Report component for the load test and start the test.
. The Dashboard will show the following
.. Load initially growing on the primary breaker calling out to the details service.
.. Then when the max number of threads are being consumed some load will be shed to the cache circuit breaker.  The purple
number (Rejected) reflects the number of request being shed to the fallback.
